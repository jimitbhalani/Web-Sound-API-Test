Project to test the audio-api. Currently the code "audiocontext.js" takes in a single audio file and uses the arraybuffer to store it using XMLHttpRequest

The sound file resides in the folder itself. If you want to change the audio file, please change the audio file name in the "audiocontext.js" script file

The audio file name can be changed in the init function under XMLHttpRequest open()

The project contains a basic html file to play, stop and control the volume of the sound file

Run the HTML file!!
